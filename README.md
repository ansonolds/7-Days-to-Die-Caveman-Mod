# 7-Days-to-Die-Caveman-Mod-
Ever wish you could kill zombies while living in the stone age with only stone tools? Yeah, me too!
Copy the "Caveman-Modlet" folder into your "Mods" Folder within the 7-Days-to-die main folder. 
This is usually found in your steamLibrary/steamapps folders.
If you haven't already done so, create a map using NitroGen map builder with no POI's, no Traders, no Roads.
(This will throw up a NullReference error when you complete the starter quests. 
You can "fix" this by closing the find trader quest in game.
Turn AirDrops off, and the rest is how you like it. 
We normally play with all default settings with sharedxp radius to maximum.
